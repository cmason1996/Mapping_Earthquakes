# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to display earthquake data from all over the world for the last 7 calendar days. To do this we use GeoJSON data to display the earthquake locations and magnitude size in an easy to view and interactive map. Three different viewing layers are built into the map as well as three different layers for Earthquakes, Tectonic Plate boundaries, and Major Earthquakes that can be turned on or off as the user desires. Each earthquake marker can be clicked on to reveal the magnitude and location of the earthquake. Traditionally this map would be centered on the continental center of North America but we choose to center the map on Zagora, Morocco which puts the entire plnetary surface into view. This gives the user the ability to see all of the recorded earthquakes without having to toggle or zoom.
